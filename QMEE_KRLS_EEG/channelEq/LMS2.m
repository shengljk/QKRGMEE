%Function LMS3:
%Normalized least mean square algorithms
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Input:
%trainInput:    input signal inputDimension*trainSize, inputDimension is the input dimension and trainSize 
%               is the number of training data
%trainTarget:   desired signal for training trainSize*1
%
%testInput:     testing input for calculating the learning curve, 
%               inputDimension*testSize, testSize is the number of test data
%testTarget:    desired signal for testing testSize*1
%
%regularizationFactor: regularization factor in Newton's recursion
%
%stepSizeWeightVector:  learning rate for weight part, set to zero to disable
%stepSizeBias:          learning rate for bias term, set to zero to disable
%
%flagLearningCurve: A FLAG to indicate if learning curve is needed
%
