%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Function KAPA2
%Kernel affine projection algorithm 2 (with Newton' recursion)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Input:
%trainInput:    input signal inputDimension*trainSize, inputDimension is the input dimension and 
%               trainSize is the number of training data
%trainTarget:   desired signal for training trainSize*1
%
%testInput:     testing input, inputDimension*testSize, testSize is the number of the test data
%testTarget:    desired signal for testing testSize*1
%
%typeKernel:    'Gauss', 'Poly'
%paramKernel:   h (kernel size) for Gauss and p (order) for poly
%
%regularizationFactor: regularization parameter in Newton's recursion
%
%stepSizeFeatureVector:     learning rate for kernel part
%stepSizeWeightVector:      learning rate for linear part, set to zero to disable
%stepSizeBias:              learning rate for bias term, set to zero to disable
%
%flagLearningCurve:    control if calculating the learning curve
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Output:
%baseDictionary:            dictionary stores all the bases centers
%expansionCoefficient:      coefficients of the kernel expansion
%weightVector:      the linear weight vector
%biasTerm:          the bias term
%learningCurve:     trainSize*1 used for learning curve
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Notes: Since bases are by default all the training data, it is skipped
%       here.
