%Function LMS1:
%Normal least mean square algorithms
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Input:
%K:             the K most recent observations are used to estimate the
%               gradient and hessian
%trainInput:    input signal inputDimension*trainSize, inputDimension is the input dimension and trainSize 
%               is the number of training data
%trainTarget:   desired signal for training trainSize*1
%
%testInput:     testing input for calculating the learning curve, 
%               inputDimension*testSize, testSize is the number of test data
%testTarget:    desired signal for testing testSize*1
%
%stepSizeWeightVector:  learning rate for weight part, set to zero to disable
%stepSizeBias:          learning rate for bias term, set to zero to disable
%
%flagLearningCurve: A FLAG to indicate if learning curve is needed
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Output:
%weightVector:      the linear coefficients
%biasTerm:          the bias term
%learningCurve:     trainSize*1 used for learning curve
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Notes: none.
